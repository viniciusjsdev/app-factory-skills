# Skill Sequences

There is no mandatory global sequence. Select one factory based on the user's current objective. Cross-factory handoffs are optional and require explicit invocation.

## MVP Factory

```txt
Idea or PRD
  -> product-brief-architect
  -> @sites + app-factory-frontend-builder
  -> django-backend-service-architect
  -> app-factory-backend-router
  -> OpenCode Go or Codex + django-backend-code-executor
  -> django-backend-service-architect audit
  -> app-factory-infra-orchestrator
  -> publication and MVP validation
```

This sequence is self-contained. Do not insert market research or marketing as a prerequisite.

## Research Factory

```txt
Market question
  -> market-research-architect
  -> app-factory-research-router
  -> specialized retrieval/analysis tasks
  -> market-validation-harness
  -> decision and next experiment
```

- Use `app-market-intelligence-analyst` for iOS app/developer/family/cohort economics through AppStoreTracker plus Apple confirmation.
- Use OpenAlex for scholarly discovery and inspect original papers for substantive claims.
- Use Perplexity only as an optional broad-web discovery mechanism.
- Use `manus-platform-researcher` for bounded read-only research inside native/authenticated platforms.
- Codex owns normalization, synthesis, and the final adversarial review.

## Marketing Factory

```txt
Product or launch input
  -> commercial-launch-architect
  -> marketing-creative-builder
  -> app-factory-commercial-router
  -> Codex, human, or manus-commercial-operator
  -> commercial-validation-analyst
```

- Codex owns launch strategy, account information, copy, creative preparation, and analysis.
- The human owns account creation, credentials, verification, 2FA, connector authorization, and final external-action approval.
- Manus owns only bounded native actions and measurement after approval.
- Platform-native discovery belongs to the Research Factory, not the action task.

## Optional handoffs

- Accepted research may be supplied to `product-brief-architect` or `commercial-launch-architect`.
- An existing MVP may be supplied to `commercial-launch-architect` without prior research.
- Commercial results may motivate a new research request or product change, but neither starts automatically.
- Every optional handoff preserves the producer artifact and records user approval.
