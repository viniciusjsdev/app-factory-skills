# Product Workflow

## 1. Product definition

`product-brief-architect` accepts a rough idea, PRD, notes, market problem, feature list, or screen list. It preserves an existing PRD and creates the missing executable contracts.

Small products use `docs/product/product-brief.md`. Larger products use PRD, screen map, business rules, data contract, visual direction, and acceptance criteria under `docs/product/`.

## 2. Frontend construction

The standard command invokes external `@sites` together with `$app-factory-frontend-builder`. Sites owns the visible preview and publication. The frontend skill consumes product contracts and remains the mandatory contract for React stack, routes, feature pages, hooks/view models, services, repository adapters, realistic mocks, local persistence, responsive states, tests, and frontend/API handoff documents. Sites is not installed as an application dependency.

## 3. Django backend

`django-backend-service-architect` consumes product rules, data contracts, authorization expectations, frontend service contracts, and acceptance criteria. It creates and audits backend contracts and enriches project context. `django-backend-code-executor` implements approved contracts with all ORM access in repositories, business rules in persistence-agnostic services, DTO-defined controller payloads, configured CamelCase entities, and Django-generated migrations.

## 4. Infrastructure and publication

`app-factory-infra-orchestrator` consumes the validated frontend/backend shape, environment contract, database ownership, and deployment choice. It prepares local Docker and selected hosting paths without inventing missing application settings.
