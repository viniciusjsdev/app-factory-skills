name: marketing-creative-builder
description: Build a channel-ready marketing creative pack from an approved launch contract, brand inputs, product evidence, and available screenshots or assets. Use for captions, carousels, short-video scripts, stories, ad variants, outreach drafts, landing copy, briefs, alt text, UTM metadata, and a production manifest. It creates artifacts but never publishes or contacts users.

# Marketing Creative Builder

## Purpose

Translate an approved commercial strategy into reusable, measurable creative assets without changing the strategy or making unsupported claims.

## Invocation Boundary

- Require a commercial launch contract or an equivalent approved brief containing audience, objective, channel, CTA, claims, and constraints.
- Do not choose a new market, audience, offer, price, or positioning silently.
- Do not publish, schedule, message, upload, buy media, or edit external accounts.
- Do not require that the product was built by the MVP Factory.

## Workflow

### 1. Verify inputs

Confirm channel, placement, campaign/experiment ID, audience, awareness stage, primary message, allowed proof, prohibited claims, CTA, destination, language, tone, visual assets, and approval owner. Return missing strategic decisions to `$commercial-launch-architect`.

### 2. Create a message system

Define the core promise, problem framing, proof, objection response, CTA, and 3-5 reusable message angles. Label unproven angles as hypotheses. Avoid fake urgency, fake scarcity, invented testimonials, and claims that exceed product evidence.

### 3. Build channel-specific artifacts

Follow `references/channel-specs.md`. Produce only requested formats, such as:

- Instagram/TikTok short-video hook, shot list, voiceover, on-screen text, caption, cover, and CTA;
- carousel slide copy, visual direction, caption, and alt text;
- stories with frame sequence and interaction prompt;
- static/post copy and visual brief;
- paid-ad variants only when paid media is explicitly in scope;
- creator outreach or customer-contact drafts, never sent automatically;
- landing/store-listing copy tied to the same message and conversion event.

When final bitmap generation is requested, invoke the available `imagegen` skill/tool for the image work. This skill remains responsible for the brief, claims, channel fit, variants, and QA.

### 4. Design real variants

Follow `references/experiment-variants.md`. Change one decision-driving dimension per experiment where possible: hook, proof, problem frame, format, or CTA. Do not label cosmetic differences as distinct hypotheses.

### 5. Add measurement metadata

Record campaign, creative, variant, channel, placement, CTA, destination, UTM values, hypothesis, primary metric, and pass/fail rule. Keep link metadata out of visible copy when the channel handles it separately.

### 6. QA and package

Use `references/creative-quality.md`. Produce the manifest defined in `assets/creative-pack-manifest.schema.json`, with source files, previews, dimensions/duration, copy, alt text, claims, approvals, and publication readiness.

## Required Output

- creative strategy summary tied to the launch contract;
- channel-ready copy and production instructions;
- visual/video briefs and generated assets when requested;
- genuine experiment variants;
- accessibility fields;
- UTM and measurement metadata;
- claim/proof register;
- manifest with status `draft`, `review_required`, or `approved_for_routing`.

## Hard Stops

Do not mark a pack ready when a claim lacks evidence, required brand/product assets are missing, a platform format is unknown, regulated wording lacks approval, or the CTA/destination is unresolved.
